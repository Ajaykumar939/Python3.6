# for <variable> in <sequence>:

#    # which requires repeated execution

# range(n): generates a set of whole numbers starting from 0 to (n-1).
# for i in range(10):
#     print(i)

# range(start, stop): generates a set of whole numbers starting from start to stop-1.
# for i in range(0,111):
#     print(i)

# range(start, stop, step_size): The default step_size is 1 which is why when we didnâ€™t specify the step_size, the numbers generated are having difference of 1. However by specifying step_size we can generate numbers having the difference of step_size.
